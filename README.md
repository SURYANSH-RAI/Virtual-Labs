## Introduction

Welcome to the Virtual-Labs project! This repository contains 12 Physics labs that can be accessed virtually. The readings of experiments are based on my self-observations, when I was in 12th grade.
This project was made when i was a kid but now i am seriously working upon it to deploy and create the project again with a framework and move that project under the initiative of #AatmanirbharBharat.

<br> 

## Purpose

This project aims to support students having access to tablets/smartphones or Laptop/Desktop but lacking proper lab facilities in schools to understand experiment methodologies.

<br>

## Project Overview

<br> 

+ ### Labs Included
  - Ohm's law and resistance
  - Potentiometer - Internal Resistance of a Cell
  - Potentiometer - Comparison of emf
  - Figure of Merit of a Galvanometer
  - Metre bridge - Resistance of a wire
  - Production of Induced emf in a Coil
  - Induced emf in Inductive Circuit
  - Conversion of Galvanometer to Ammeter
  - Metre bridge - Law of combination of resistors
  - Diode Characteristics
  - Zener Diode
  - Transistor Characteristics

<br>

+ ### Technologies Used
  - CSS
  - HTML
  - JavaScript

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SURYANSH-RAI/Virtual-Labs.git
cd Virtual-Labs
open index.html
```

<br>

## Future Plans
- **Reconstruct** the labs using a modern framework.
- **Deploy** the project for children with tablets or phones.
- **Enhance** the labs with interactive features for a more engaging learning experience.
- **AI chat Agent** to help if user or childer get stuck anywhere or help them how to get hands on lab.
